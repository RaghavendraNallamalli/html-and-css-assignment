                        Alluri Sitarama Raju (4 July 1897 – 7 May 1924)[1] was an Indian revolutionary who waged an armed campaign against British colonial rule in India. Born in the Madras Presidency, he became involved in anti-British activities in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which effectively restricted the free movement of Adivasis (tribal communities) in their forest habitats and prevented them from practicing a traditional form of agriculture known as podu. Rising discontent towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion of 1922, in which he played a major part as a leader. Mustering a force combined of Adivasis, farmers and sympathizers to their cause, he engaged in guerilla campaigns against the British colonial authorities in the border regions of the Madras Presidency (now part of the districts of East Godavari and Visakhapatnam). He was nicknamed "Manyam Veerudu" (transl. Hero of the Jungle) by local villagers for his heroic exploits

                    <p> <strong> Birth and childhood</strong>  </p>
                    
                        <li>Alluri Sitarama Raju was born into a Telugu speaking family, in the current state of Andhra Pradesh, India. His father, Venkata Rama Raju, was a professional photographer, who settled in the town of Rajamundry for his vocation, and his mother, Surya Narayanamma was a pious homemaker</li>
                        <li>His date of birth is disputed, with some sources reporting it as 4 July 1897,[3][7] and others as 4 July 1898.[4][8] Details of his place of birth vary, as an official report suggests he was born in Bhimavaram,[4] with several other sources citing it to be the village of Mogallu in West Godavari District.[9][10][7] New reports suggest the village of Pandrangi in Bheemunipatnam is his precise place of birth</li>
                        <li>Venkata Rama Raju was a free spirited man, with immense self respect, and great love for freedom.</li>
                        <li>He once chided a young Rama Raju for practicing the then prevalent custom of Indian people saluting the Europeans acknowledging their superiority. He passed away when his son was in his eighth year.</li>

                           <p>
                            He completed his primary education and joined High school in Kakinada, where he became a friend of Madduri Annapurnaiah (1899–1954), who later grew up to be another prominent Indian revolutionary. In his teens, Rama Raju, in accordance with his reticent and meditative nature, contemplated taking up Sannyasa. At age 15, he moved to his mother's home town of Visakhapatnam and enrolled at Mrs. A.V.N. College for the fourth form exam. While there, he often visited far flung areas in the Visakhapatnam district, and became familiar with the struggles of the tribal people there.[12]

                    <div class="event-desc event-desc-nth-child"><li>After the passing of the 1882 Madras Forest Act, in an attempt to exploit the economic value of wooded areas, its restrictions on the free movement of tribal people in the forests prevented them from engaging in their traditional podu agricultural system, a form of subsistence economy which involved the system of Shifting cultivation.</li>
                    <li>Rama Raju harnessed this discontent of the tribal people to support his anti-colonial zeal, whilst accommodating the grievances of those muttadars sympathetic to his cause, rather than those who were selfish in their pursuit of a revived status for themselves. This meant that most of his followers were from the tribal communities, but also included some significant people from the muttadar class, who at one time had exploited them, although many muttadars remained ambivalent about fighting for what he perceived to be the greater good
                    </li>
                    <li>Alluri adopted aspects from the Non-cooperation movement, such as promoting temperance, and the boycott of colonial courts in favour of local justice, administered by panchayat courts, to attract people's support. Although the movement died out in early 1922, it had reached the plains area by then, as he was involved in the propagation of some of its methods among the hill people, to raise their political consciousness, and desire for change. These actions caused him to be put under the surveillance of police, from around February of that year, although the fact that he was using them as a camouflage to foment armed uprising seems to have not been recognised by either the movement, or the political leadership of the British.
